# plzcompiler
This is an old study project back from 2004 from the compiler course. We implemented an compiler for a language called PLZ. There are some samples within the plz-samples directory. The compiler does currently not support pointers, stdin and stdout of text. 

I just added the project to github not for anyone to use it but to save it for the future. 

In the next time I will add the grammar for PLZ and some extended readme.
